*************************************/

1. COMBO TYPES
The following combo types are new:
	Generic
		This is a generic combo where you, as the user, may define 
		a number of properties that are governed by the ZC engine.
		
	Step->Effects
		This combo type has special effects if the player walks on
		top of it. 

These additional combo types support extra features:
	Script 1 to 20
		These combos now support engine properties identicl to the
		Generic type, if the Engine flag is enabled. 
		
	Damage Combos
		You may now specify the damage amount. 
		
	Lockblock
		You may now specify a required item, a counter to affect, 
		the amount of keys or counter points consumed, and the
		sound of unlocking the block. 
		
		You may specify to unlock without draining a counter, checking
		only for a minimum counter value; or to always drain the counter,
		even if the ninimum amount is not met (but don't unlock for this).
		
	Cuttable Types
		Bush, flower, and tall grass commbo types now support some
		additional settings, including dropsets, custom sound effects,
		special items, and custom visual effects.
		
	Armos/Statue
		You can now specify the enemies that statue combos generate, 
		along with determining if they randomise between two enemies.
		
	Warp Types
		Stairs, Sensitive Warp, Swim Warp, and Dive Warp combos now all
		permit setting a sound effect to play during the warp.
		These also work as FFCs.

	Step Types
		Step->Next, and Step->Secret combo types now allow setting a sound
		effect to play when the Hero steps on them.
	
	Chest types
		Chest, Locked Chest, and Boss Locked Chest now allow a 'button' to be assigned.
		This only works if the 'Old Chest Collision' QR is disabled.

2. TRIGGER WEAPONS
	Combos now have a set of flags with which you can set weapons that trigger
	their new properties. 

3. ATTRIBUTES
	Combos now have three sets of numeric attributes, on three tabs in the Combo Editor.
	The values on Attribytes Tab are restricted to a range of 0 to 255,
	The values on Attrishorts Tab are restricted to a range of -32768 to 32767,
	and the values on Attributes Tab are restricted to a range of -214748.3648 to 214748.3647.
	
4. FLAGS
	Combos now have flags that affect their function, and interact with the values set
	on the Attributes tabs. Many new effects require enabling these flags, to function. 

6. LABEL
	This is a text field via which you can apply a label (e.g. custom name) to the combo.
	Scripts can read this label, and use it to match combos to a scriptside string, or
	look up a combo ID using its label using Game->GetCombo("name").
	
7. SCRIPT ACCESS
	ZScript has access to all of the new Combo Editor values. Please see ZScript_Additions.txt
	under 'combodata' for further information.

On the (Triggered By) tabs in the Combo Editor, you will see a list of all
of the weapon types that can trigger combos.

At present, these flags work for the following weapon types:

Triggered By (1)
	Sword			:
	Swordbeam		:
	Boomerang		:
	Bomb			: Bomb Explosions
	Super Bomb		: Superbomb Explosions
	Lit Bomb		: Placed (Unexploded) Bomb
	Lit Superbomb		: Plced (Unexploded) Superbomb
	Arrow			: 
	Fire			: Fire from ANY source. 
	Whistle			: This weapon is normlly screenwide.
	Bait			: Placed Enemy Bait
	Wand			: The Wand Stick
	Magic			: Magic shot from the Wand or other sources.
	Wind			: Wind generated by the Whistle, or other sources.
	Reflected Magic		: Reflected Enemy Magic
	Reflected Fireball	: Reflected Enemy Fireblls
	Reflected Rock		: Reflected Enemy Rocks
	Hammer			:
	Hookshot		: The Hookshot Head
	Sparkle			: Fire and Silver Sparkles, and Scripted LW_SPARKLE.
	Byrna Beams		: Byrna Orbiting Bems
	Reflected Swordbeam	: Reflected Enemy Swordbeam
	Stomp			: The Stomp Effect
	
Triggered By (2)
	Script/Custom 1		:
	Script/Custom 2		:
	Script/Custom 3		:
	Script/Custom 4		:
	Script/Custom 5		:
	Script/Custom 6		:
	Script/Custom 7		:
	Script/Custom 8		:
	Script/Custom 9		:
	Script/Custom 10	:

You may specify a minimum weapon level on [Triggered By (1)].
If you set a minimum, then it applies as the minimum level to all 
weapon interactions with the combo.

If the combo is struck by one of the selected weapon types, and 
the weapon qualifies for the minimum level (if any), then the combo 
will produce EVENTS based on the attributes that you set.

If a weapon is spoofing another type, such as an arrow set to Weapon Type
Sword in the Item Editor, then the combo will react only to the spoofed type.

Generic Triggers

	This combo type allows you to set the outcome of being triggered by
	one of the specified weapons. All of its mechanics are governed by
	the vrious flags, attributes, and properties that you set.

				: If the VISUAL flag is enabled, the combo will
				: generate a sprite.

				: flag, then you may set the Sprite field to a 
				: value of 1, 2, or 3, s follows:

	Attributes 2
		These attributes are not used for this combo type at this time, 
		but scripts can access them. 
	Flags
		The following are the flags available for this combo type,
		and the effects of each flag:
		
		Visuals
			If enabled, triggering the combo will spawn
			a visual effect. This interacts with the CLIPPINGS
			flag to determine the type of effect, and the value
			used for the effect is set from the SPRITE field.
		Itemdrop
			If enabled, the combo will drop an item when triggered.
			This interacts with the following flags:
				Specific Item, Room Item
		SFX
			If enabled, then triggering the combo will play a sound
			specified in the SOUND field.
		Next
			If enabled, when triggered, the combo will be replaced
			by the next combo in the list, or by the Screen Undercombo.
			This interacts with the following flags:
				Continuous, Undercombo
		Continuous
			If enabled, and the NEXT flag is also enabled, then the combo
			will be continually replaced in the same frame by the next combo
			if its type matches, and it also has the Next and Continuous flags
			set. Once the next possible combo differs, or does not have these 
			flags set, then the event stops. 
			This interacts with the following flags:
				Next
		Room Item
			If set, then triggering the combo will spawn an item with an ID
			matching the Room Special Item. 
		No Poof
		`	If the Drop Enemy flag is set, then the 'Room Item' flag morphs
			into the No Poof flag. If set, enemies spawned by triggering the
			combo will instantly appear without the normal spawn-in sprite.
		Secrets
			If enabled, triggering the combo will trigger the Screen Secrets 
			matching the value of the Secret Type field.
		Kill Wpn
			If enabled, then when a weapon intercts with the combo, its deadstate
			is immediately set to Dead, destroying the weapon. 
		Engine/Flag 9
			This flag is only for Custom (e.g. Script 1 to 20) combo types.
			If enabled, then the combo uses the same engine properties as the
			'Generic' combo type, and all of labels for the attributes and flags
			for this combo in the Combo Editor will transform to match those of
			the 'Generic' combo type.
			Otherwise, Custom/Script combo types have no defined engine chracteristics.
			This interacts with the following flags:
				ALL
		Clippings
			If enbled, and the Visuals flag is enabled, then the sprite generated by
			the combo will be one of the old, hardcoded engine 'grass clippings' sprites.
			This interacts with the following flags:
				Visuals
		Specific Item
			If enabled, and the Itemdrop flag is also enabled, then instead of dropping
			an item from  Dropset, the combo will drop a specific item with an ID matching
			the value of the Dropset field.
			This interacts with the following flags:
				Itemdrop
		Undercombo
			If enbled, and the Next flag is also enabled, then instead of advancing to the
			next combo in the list when triggered, the combo will be replaced by the Screen
			Undercombo.
			This interacts with the following flags:
				Next
		Always Drop
			Not implemented at this time.
		Drop Enemy
			If enabled, the combo will spawn an enemy instead of an item when triggered.
			The enemy that is spwns will have an ID matching the value of the Dropset field,
			and appears at the location of the triggered combo.
			If the combo is not  'Next' trigger, then it is possible to repeatedly spawn
			enemies from it.
			If the No Poof flag is lso enabled, then the enemy will apper without its spawn
			sprite animation first occurring. Otherwise, it spawns in fifteen frames after
			the combo is triggered, following the spawn poof.

Custom (Script) 1 to 20
	The 'Script' combo type now allows you to either set custom properties that are read by 
	scripts, or to use the same engine properties as Generic combos. 
	
	To use the engine effects, enable the Engine flag on Attributes Tab 1. 
	
	Without this flag enabled, all of the values of Attributes and Flags are solely used
	by ZScript.

Lockblock Combos
	You may now specify a number of events or requirements to unlock lockblock combos.
	
	Attributes Tab 1
	
		Item
			This field is used to specify an item ID for an item required to
			unlock the lockblock. It does nothing if the 'Require' flag is not
			enabled. 
		Counter
			This field is used to specify a counter to affect (e.g., drain) in
			order to open the lockblock. You may specify keys, if you wish, but
			you are able to use any counter.
			
			The following are the legal values for the counter to affect:
				
				0 - Life
				1 - Money
				2 - Bombs
				3 - Arrows
				4 - Magic
				5 - Keys
				6 - Super Bombs
				7 - Custom 1
				8 - Custom 2
				9 - Custom 3
				10 - Custom 4
				11 - Custom 5
				12 - Custom 6
				13 - Custom 7
				14 - Custom 8
				15 - Custom 9
				16 - Custom 10
				17 - Custom 11
				18 - Custom 12

				27 - Custom 21
				28 - Custom 22
				29 - Custom 23
				30 - Custom 24
				31 - Custom 25
				
			To affect a counter, you must enable the Counter flag, and set a value
			to the Amount field on Attributes Tab 2. Otherwise, this does nothing.
			
		Sound
			This field allows you to specify the sound effect of opening the lock,
			overriding the normal system 'Unlock Door' sound effect.
			To use this, you must enable the SFX flag, and set the Sound field
			to the value of a sound effect ID. 
			
			You may enable the flag and set it to 0 for the lock to be silent.
		
	Attributes Tab 2
	
		Amount
			This field is used to specify either an amount of keys required to
			open the lockblock, or the amount by which to drain a counter.
			
			If the Counter flag is not enabled, and the value of the Amount field
			is greater than zero, then the lockblock will require a number of keys
			equal to the value specified in the Amount field. 
			
			The maximum value for any counter is 65563. 
	Flags
		
		Require
